## 📦 ReClaim — AI-Driven Material Intelligence for Circular Campuses

### Project Description

**ReClaim** is a mobile-first, AI-powered sustainability platform designed to transform **laboratory and institutional waste into actionable student project opportunities**.
Instead of treating discarded materials as disposal problems, ReClaim treats each waste event as a **decision-making opportunity**—connecting materials, student skills, and environmental impact through intelligent automation.

College laboratories and small-scale institutions regularly discard reusable materials such as PCBs, metal scraps, acrylic sheets, wood, and electronic components due to lack of visibility, coordination, and incentive structures. ReClaim addresses this gap by introducing an **end-to-end material intelligence system** that enables reuse, collaboration, and measurable sustainability outcomes within a campus ecosystem.

## 🧠 How ReClaim Works

ReClaim follows a **non-linear, decision-centric workflow**:

1. **Material Detection & Structuring**
   Lab waste is captured via photo upload or camera input.
   Computer vision models automatically identify material types, quantities, and conditions, generating structured inventory with confidence scores and editable specifications.

2. **Spatial Inventory & Hyper-Local Discovery**
   Detected materials are mapped to campus locations using geospatial tagging.
   Students and labs can discover nearby materials through distance-aware filtering and availability-based discovery.

3. **Student Demand & Skill Signals**
   Students create skill profiles and post time-bound material requests for academic or personal projects.
   These signals continuously feed into the system’s intelligence layer.

4. **AI Material Intelligence Engine (Core)**
   The central intelligence engine analyzes material availability, student skills, and constraints to:

   * Generate feasible project ideas
   * Rank best-fit student matches
   * Estimate material-specific carbon savings
     The output is consolidated into a single **Opportunity Card**, enabling fast, informed decisions.

5. **Opportunity Allocation & Barter Mechanism**
   Labs can approve opportunities with a single action.
   In cases where incentives are needed, ReClaim enables **skill-for-material barter**, allowing students to exchange project assistance for material access—removing monetary and procurement friction.

6. **Lifecycle Closure & Impact Tracking**
   Every material lot is tracked through its lifecycle:
   *Detected → Matched → Picked Up → In Use → Completed*
   ReClaim logs verified reuse, calculates CO₂ savings, and generates department-level sustainability metrics.

## 🌱 Key Capabilities

* **Computer Vision–based material categorization**
* **Geospatial inventory mapping & hyper-local discovery**
* **AI-driven project ideation and student matching**
* **Unified Opportunity Cards for decision-making**
* **Material–project barter system**
* **End-to-end lifecycle and carbon impact tracking**

## 🎯 Why ReClaim Is Different

Most sustainability platforms stop at listing or matching resources.
ReClaim goes further by acting as a **decision system**, not a marketplace.

* It reduces cognitive load by converting raw waste data into **ready-to-approve opportunities**
* It aligns incentives through collaboration rather than payments
* It closes the loop with verifiable reuse and measurable environmental impact

By embedding intelligence directly into the waste management workflow, ReClaim makes **reuse the default choice**, not an afterthought.
